# Agent-Based-Market-Microstructure-Simulation
This project proposes the development of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for the Financial Markets to analyze how micro-level participant behaviors
aggregate into macro-level market outcomes. Agent-based modelling enables a “bottom-up”
computational simulation of heterogeneous agents interacting via a central limit order book,
offering insights into emergent phenomena such as volatility clustering, flash crashes, and
systemic fragility

The primary aim of this study is to clearly define and model various types of micro-level
market participants, capturing the heterogeneity observed in real-world trading environments.
By doing so, we intend to analyze how the behaviors of these diverse agents influence
broader macro-level market phenomena. This includes exploring the emergence of price
patterns, the formation of liquidity, and the occurrence of extreme market events such as flash
crashes.
